I wish to thank my supervisor, Dr. Hannah Dee, whose patience, guidance and support throughout the project have far surpassed what should reasonably be expected form a dissertation supervisor; The staff at the National Plant Phonemics Centre, in particular Colin Sauze and Roger Boyle, for their input and providing a server for the project. 

Thanks to  my friends and peers at university for the motivation and competition through this project and the degree as a whole. I'd especially like to thank Alex Jollands and James Eusden for their help and support throughout.
