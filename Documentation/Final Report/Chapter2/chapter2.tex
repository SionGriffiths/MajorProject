\chapter{Design}

%You should concentrate on the more important aspects of the design. It is essential that an overview is presented before going into detail. As well as describing the design adopted it must also explain what other designs were considered and why they were rejected.

%The design should describe what you expected to do, and might also explain areas that you had to revise after some investigation.

%Typically, for an object-oriented design, the discussion will focus on the choice of objects and classes and the allocation of methods to classes. The use made of reusable components should be described and their source referenced. Particularly important decisions concerning data structures usually affect the architecture of a system and so should be described here.

%How much material you include on detailed design and implementation will depend very much on the nature of the project. It should not be padded out. Think about the significant aspects of your system. For example, describe the design of the user interface if it is a critical aspect of your system, or provide detail about methods and data structures that are not trivial. Do not spend time on long lists of trivial items and repetitive descriptions. If in doubt about what is appropriate, speak to your supervisor.
 
%You should also identify any support tools that you used. You should discuss your choice of implementation tools - programming language, compilers, database management system, program development environment, etc.

%Some example sub-sections may be as follows, but the specific sections are for you to define. 

\section{Overall Architecture}

MVC - for ease of testing, scalability, separation of concerns, maintainability through familiarity(people know mvc and what to expect), maturity of supporting technologies

3-tier based approach to data layer / service / presentation stuff that may not entirely fit with the mvc pattern

\section{Framework and Programming Language}

The sheer range of MVC frameworks available to developers is incredible and the decision of which to use is potentially difficult. It was not within scope to review all the available choices 

\section{Domain modelling}



\section{Database}

For this project the database structure is entirely derived by the Hibernate\cite{_hibernate} object relational mapping (ORM) which is included in the Spring framework as part of the Spring Data project. The ORM system allows a developer to annotate Java code with keywords that inform the ORM system of how to represent a given class and persist it in the database. Figure~\ref{fig:orm} shows an example of these annotations within the Plant class. The class is annotated with \texttt{@Entity} to inform the ORM that it is a managed class to be persisted and table constraints are declared. The getter methods for the instance variables in the class are annotated with relationship definitions if applicable, including foreign key mappings and what manner of database instructions should cascade through the relationship to the related entity. The annotations can also define a fetch type which can take the value \texttt{LAZY} or \texttt{EAGER}, this defines whether the related entity objects should be fully initialised when the parent is called or whether, in the case of a \texttt{LAZY} fetch, a proxy object with no instance variables initialised should be returned. For this project, the use of \texttt{LAZY} fetch is preferred in all situations since it allows greater control over the performance of the system. If for example, the Plant class made an eager fetch for it's associated list of PlantDay objects, each PlantDay would be fully initialised at the time when the Plant object is retrieved from the database via a query, resulting in extra queries to the database in order to fully populate each PlantDay. Using this fetch technique allowed the PlantDays to be initialised when a method like \texttt{.size()} was invoked on their containing list or a getter method was invoked on the PlantDay itself.

    \label{fig:orm}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:dbSchema} details the database schema resulting from the ORM annotated relationships within the system. As discussed previously in this section, the relationships are a direct result of the structure of the Java code and the choices made with certain annotations, such as which side of a relation should hold a reference to the other.

 The main deliberate change made to the default ORM mapping onto the database was to pull the dataAttributes map (a \texttt{Map<String,String>}) out from the Metadata object into its own table, `metadata\_dataattributes'. The default would have been to map this as a blob column within the metadata table, however, in order to ensure that all data within the database can be queried via native queries on the database itself, this extra table approach was taken.

\section{UI}

\section{Tools and third-party services}
\subsection{Intellij}

Intellij \cite{_intellij} is the core development tool used during the completion of this project. It is a fully featured Java integrated development environment (IDE) that has support for a wide range of features including Spring and Github (see section \ref{gitsection}) integration right out of the box. Its code completion and debugging tools are significantly more refined in comparison to the most popular alternative Eclipse, allowing for faster writing of code and easier debugging. As with any reasonably modern IDE, IntelliJ comes with the facility to run sophisticated test suites, providing code coverage metrics and providing auto-generated method stubs in implementation or test classes further speeding up development time, especially in boiler-plate heavy languages such as Java.

IntelliJ also provides in-built static analysis tools that run automatically has part of committing changes to version control via the IDE. This is useful as it is configured to highlight warning level issues which include code style along with potential logical mistakes within sections of code and even spelling errors. Having these checks at commit time enables the developer to review any potential problems before the code gets checked into the repository, although the results are often a little too pessimistic they are still useful. Figure \ref{fig:intellij} shows the IntelliJ IDE with static analysis results displayed.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tools/intellij}
    \caption{The IntelliJ IDE showing result of static analysis}
    \label{fig:intellij}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Git and Github} \label{gitsection}

The use of version control is invaluable in modern software development. It has become a necessity in even the smallest of hobby projects since it allows the developer to be confident in making changes without having to worry about rescuing previous version if things go wrong and provides development teams with the means to work concurrently and collaboratively on the same code base. 

The version control system selected for this project was Git \cite{_git}, having previously used alternatives such as Subversion I chose Git for its integration with more numerous, modern services and the fact that it allows local copies of a repository which is synced with a remote repository as opposed to the remote-only approach taken by Subversion.

The Git repository for this project is hosted on Github \cite{_gitHub}, a web based service dedicated to providing git repository hosting and related facilities, such as commit history tracking, release visioning and integration with third party services. There are alternatives to Github available but due to familiarity brought on by hosting all previous projects and the fact that Github is now an industry leading solution, it was decided to use Github for this project without any real evaluation of alternatives since it was well known that Github could provide all facilities required for the purpose of this project. Figure \ref{fig:gitrel} details one of the tagged release versions of the system within Github. Having releases tagged in this way allows easy rollbacks to previous release versions in the event of any major issues in a new release. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tools/gitrel}
    \caption{A tagged release of the project within Github}
    \label{fig:gitrel}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Jira}

Jira \cite{jira} in an issue tracking and project management tool provided by Atlassian, an Australian software company. It is an industry leading product used by many companies for tracking their projects and the issues within them. Its use on this project was in support of the agile approach to project development, allowing the specification of user stories, development tasks and their inclusions within configurable sprints or development iterations. Figure \ref{fig:jira_sprint} shows the current sprint view in Jira, user stories are grouped into `lanes' corresponding to their status, allowing a simple way to track the work completed and left to do within in the current development iteration.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tools/sprint1}
    \caption{Current sprint screen in Jira}
    \label{fig:jira_sprint}
\end{figure} 

 Bugs could also be tracked as issues within Jira and added to the current sprint if necessary, I found this to be a valuable way to deal with emergent issues during development as it allowed a simple way to assign priority to urgent issues and keep track of less usgent bugs in the project backlog to be worked on in a future sprint. Figure \ref{fig:jira_bugs} shows a selection of bugs raised as part of development, Jira provides simple methods for filtering all issues against a project by type or status allowing quick access to screens such as this.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tools/jira_bugs}
    \caption{A sample of bugs raised in Jira}
    \label{fig:jira_bugs}
\end{figure} 

Another helpful feature was the integration with the version control repository hosted on Github. Referencing the issue ID in Jira in a commit message linked the commits with the issue within Jira. This provided a handy way to track development against particular issues over time and allowed a quick way to navigate between the issues in Jira and the commits on Github. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tools/jira_commit}
    \caption{The version control commit tracking within Jira}
    \label{fig:jira_commit}
\end{figure} 

There are a vast array of alternatives that could have been used for issue tracking within the project, many provide the full array of features that were used in Jira during the development of this project. However, Jira being the industry leader, provided an opportunity to gain further valuable experience of its use in a day to day, agile development project. Having previously been involved in the running of a Jira system during my time in industry provided me with familiarisation in configuring a project for my needs and confidence in being able to do so quickly. This was enough to chose Jira over the alternatives that were evaluated such as Waffle.io and the native issue tracking feature provided with Github.

\subsection{Codeship} 
Codeship\cite{_codeship} is a web based Continuous Integration(CI) service. Working in conjunction with the version control repository, Codeship will detect up any commits made to the repository hosted on Github and execute build and test scripts defined as part of the initial setup of the CI service. Use of a CI system within the project provided assurance that each incremental change made to the system integrated correctly and that all tests continued to pass. A notification would be sent in the event of build or test failure.  

 The build script for the project can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:build_script} showing how the project databases are setup and the environment is configured prior to executing the project build and test commands.

 The scripts are invoked within small Docker \cite{docker} based environments which allow build dependencies to be modularised and configured quickly. The initial integration of the CI system into the project environment was extremely simple, linking the Github repository for the project was a couple of mouse clicks and the script below is the entirety of the extra configuration required to get the CI system fully up and running. It was because of this speed and simplicity of configuration that Codeship was chosen over rival offerings such as TravisCI \cite{travis} which appeared to have a much more complex initial setup during evaluation.
